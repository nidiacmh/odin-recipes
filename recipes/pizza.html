          <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>For the Toppings</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Any desired toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, etc.)</li>
          </ol>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>

    <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes, until it becomes foamy.</li>
    <li>Add olive oil, salt, and 3 ½ cups of flour to the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for 6-8 minutes, adding more flour if necessary, until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-1 ½ hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
    <li>n a small bowl, combine the tomato sauce, oregano, basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Stir well and set aside.</li>I
    <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.</li>
    <li>Punch down the risen dough to release air bubbles, then divide it in half if you want two smaller pizzas.</li>
    <li>or stretch the dough into a circle or rectangle (about 12 inches wide if using the whole dough), depending on your baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
    <li>Place the dough on a lightly greased baking sheet or preheated pizza stone.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce, then add your desired toppings.</li>
    <li>for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    <li>Let the pizza cool for a couple of minutes, then slice and enjoy!</li>
