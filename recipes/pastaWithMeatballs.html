          </ol>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the ground meat, egg, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, and parsley until well combined.</li>
        <li>Shape the mixture into small balls, about 1 tablespoon each, and place them on a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat some olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the meatballs and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add a little more olive oil if needed and sauté the onion until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and cook for another minute, stirring to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, sugar, salt, pepper, oregano, and bay leaf. Let the sauce simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Place the meatballs in the sauce and let them cook together for 10-15 minutes, until the meatballs are fully cooked and the flavors blend.</li>
        <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta and toss it with a little of the sauce to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Serve the pasta in bowls, place some meatballs on top, and add extra sauce if desired. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan and fresh basil for garnish.</li>
